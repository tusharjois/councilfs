\section{Related Work}
\subsection{Alternative Proofs of Work}
Our work exists at the cross-section of many different active fields of research. Before this paper, there have been many proposals for Proof-of-Work schemes that serve some useful function or purpose like PrimeCoin. In a previous paper, there has also been a proposal to utilize a POR as a proof of work for the purpose of storing archival information that would be known by all miners so that validation of the files could be assured $\mathcal{F}$. The authors also assume that this file would not be updated and introduce a new stateful signature scheme that should be relatively efficient while also ensuring that a miner cannot "outsource" their computation. This differs from our scheme as we allow for the existence of other files carried by clients that are given directly to trusted nodes, called \emph{alderman}, and are not verifiable by every single node on the network.\\

Other alternative proofs of work that are similar to PORs include Proofs of Space, Proofs of Data Posession and Proofs of Erasure. Proofs of Space, for example, guarantee that a miner is holding some space it could be doing computation open and then answer challenges to ensure this is in fact the case. The way this scheme is commonly implemented is to use a form of pebbling and pebble the spaces and prove something about the graph to a verifier. One popular Proof of Space is spacemint which is unique in that it implements two different blockchains and utilizes a punishment mechanism to discentivize miners from deviating from the protocol in ways that are unlikely to happen if Proof of Work algorithms (for example, nothing at stake problems and block/challenge grinding). In our future work, we propose a similar kind of punishment mechanism. However, we use this tool to demote misbehaving Alderman and to provide recompense for grief-stricken clients. We do not propose two different blockchains/ledgers for history either. 

\subsection{Censorship Resistant File Storage}
There has also been work done previously in the creation of file storage resistant to the takedown of particular governments and agencies. Publius, for example, was proposed as a method of resistance in which n servers host the encrypted content but in order to get the key a client must obtain k-out-of-n secret shares that are also controlled by these servers. While there is plausible deniability on the part of the servers, as they are hosting encrypted material, there is no mechanism or recompense in place for servers electing to delete their shares and no way to communicate this information to all of the other servers readily on the network. What this paper attempts to do is fundamentally different as we not only want to provide a mechanism by which servers can help dissidents/clients but we want to provide them an incentive to do so as well. Namely, in the form of money or currency.

Of note is the command \verb+\citet+, which produces citations
appropriate for use in inline text.  For example,
\begin{verbatim}
   \citet{hasselmo} investigated\dots
\end{verbatim}
produces
